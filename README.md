This repository contains the latest version of my [Bachelor's Thesis](Thesis.pdf) "Development of a Redis management platform with serverless microservices on AWS".
This thesis was discussed on September 25, 2019 at the University of Padova.
The slides are available [here](Slides.pdf).

## Thesis Abstract

> This document describes Queue Controller, a software designed and developed by [Alberto Schiabel](https://github.com/jkomyno) during his internship at [Pagination SrL](https://pagination.com). The allotted period for the internship has been 320 hours, spread between June and August 2019. Queue Controller offers a web-based solution to monitor and interact with business data stored in a Redis database. The system is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is composed of multiple microservices running in serverless AWS Lambda functions.
> 
> This thesis describes the reasons why that software was built, the technologies involved,the development phases and the intended future use. This document also includes some discussions about the importance of software testing and the advantages of automated deployments of software artifacts.
> 
> Due to the existence of a non-disclosure agreement with the hosting company, this document only presents a portion of the work done at Pagination S.r.L.
